Hi Sriram,

When you issue the SET TRACE POINT and SET TRACE RECORD do you get any response?

What do you get out of SET TRACE POINT SC1000 - does it mention SC930?

Does /usr/trace_record exist and can ingres write to it?

If you don't have II_DBMS_LOG already enabled it might be worth setting it - you can use SET TRACE OUTPUT '' to set it for the current dbms. The dbms log would show the trace point being issued and may show errors if there's a problem.

Very early versions of SC930 didn't do much error reporting or checking. What patch are you on? $II_SYSTEM/ingres/files/version.rel would show that.

Regards

Paul
